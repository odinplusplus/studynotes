. what is a resource ?
    = something that must be acquired and released later
        < others may want to use them
    #  memory, shoes on the bowling lane

. what is ownership ?

    # local variable of type String is responsible for releasing the resource it owns when the variable goes out of scope
        the resource is the memory from the heap

    = someone has ownership of a resource and transfers it to another
    # when the parameter type of a function is String, the parameter will be the new owner
