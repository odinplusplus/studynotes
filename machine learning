. what is information ?
    = something used to differentiate two things

. what does it mean for one date to be more informative than another ?
    = it can differentiate more things
    # if I have a collection of names, I can differentiate more people if the name is a first name + last name, than if it were just a first name

. what is the representation of something ?
    = a possible description of that something
    # 8 in base 10 is 8; 8 in base 2 is 1000: both 8 and 1000 can represent 8
    one representation can be more informative than another
        # today can be described by just the day, or by both the day and the month
            the second alternative is more informative than the first

. what is data ?
    = a physical encoding of a representation of an entity
    # stack of business record papers
    # numbers represented in binary form stored on an SSD

. what is a function ?  
    = association between the elements of one set (domain) and the elements of another set (codomain)  
    an element of the domain is associated with only one element of the codomain  
        such an element of the codomain, in this case, is called the image of the element of the domain  
    input = element of the domain  
    output = image of the input  
    # associate the days of the week (monday, tuesday, ...) to my evaluation (good or bad)  
        all days of the week are 'good' for me!  
    solving real-world problems can use equations  
        'problem' can be used as a synonym for 'process' in various situations  
        # from 'I have 10 dollars. I went to the market and spent 3 dollars. I found 2 dollars on the street. How many dollars do I have?' to 'x=10-3+2'  
            note that x is a pure number without semantics (in the case of this problem, it would be dollars that the individual possesses)  
        functions can be used when the input varies, applying equations to other situations  
            ! we can do this because we have access to information that influences the problem  
            # in the previous example, the amount of dollars found on the street can be made a variable: x = 10-3+d  
            ! we went from problem information -> function -> data, but what if we do the opposite ?  
                = from a dataset about 'process executions' obtain a function that describes the problem/process
                    < obtain the solution for other inputs  
                    < understand the nature/structure of the problem  
                        remember that in the reverse path we had access to information that influences the problem, but not in this case
                        why is the data like this?
                        # the structure of the hydrogen atom was 'elucidated' from the function/equation of energy transition obtained via data  

. what is a parameter ?  
    = the parameter of a function can be understood as an identifier for that function within a group of functions  

. what is function composition ?  
    = describing a more complex function using simpler functions already known  
    uses:  
        . facilitate the interpretation of the more complex function  
        . calculate the derivative of this new function  
            you have no idea how difficult it is to calculate the derivative by formal definition        

. what is a pattern ?  
    = describing a function with 'simpler' functions  
        ! note the similarity with the definition of function composition  
    identification of a pattern is subjective  
        < depends on the functions that the individual (or machine) already knows  

. what is machine learning ?  
    = automated search for a function from data about a certain problem/process
        the function is that of the path 'data -> function -> problem' in the item 'what is a function ?'  

. what is a neural network ?  
    = describes a complex function through the composition of simpler functions  
    since there is composition, it learns not just one, but each one of the functions that makes up the network  
        > can be reused in other networks  
        > easier to interpret the network  

. what is deep learning ?  
    = a type of machine learning that uses neural networks  
    a set of functions is defined (by having defined the primitive functions used), and an attempt is made to find a 'good' function
        'good' function = you can define what this means
